        and Preferred Members in an Herbalife Distributor’s downline. (The downline 
        organization consists of all Distributors and Preferred Members that were 
        personally sponsored by a particular Distributor, and in turn, all other persons 
        sponsored by the subsequent Distributors.) To the extent the Lineage Report 
        contains data from persons outside of the United States, we have taken appropriate 
        measures to protect the data in accordance with applicable law. Lineage Reports

        share your information with Distributors so that they can provide you with a more 
        personalized experience, such as recommending products and services that are most 
        relevant to you. Herbalife Distributors who receive your information are bound by 
        the terms of their Distributorship Agreement and the privacy and data protection 
        covenants contained therein. Some of these Distributors may be based in countries 
        that do not offer the same or a similar level of privacy protection as is 
        available in your own country.
